# Space Impact "Remake"

![space_impact_gameplay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59567076/84587305-51a15180-ae1e-11ea-9df9-b27122a824f8.gif)

Little "game" inspired by Space Impact. Project created while learning python.
This project is based on project from book "Python Crash Course" and I modified it quite a bit.
For example I added little "system" to manage changes in resolution, changed concept of the game from vertical to horizontal,
added more types of aliens, writing highscore to a .txt file and others.
I had a lot of fun with this project. 

To play this "game", you need to download everything and run file "space_impact.py". You will also need pygame.

I will be grateful for any feedback and opinions.
Thank you :-)
