# space-impact
Little "game" inspired by Space Impact. Project created while learning python.
This project is based on project from book "Python Crash Course" and I modified it quite a bit.
For example I added little "system" to manage changes in resolution, changed concept of the game from vertical to horizontal,
added more types of aliens, writing highscore to a .txt file and others.
I had a lot of fun with this project. I will be grateful for any feedback and opinions.
Thank you :-)
